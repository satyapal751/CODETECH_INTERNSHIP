📸 This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
🧠 The model is trained to recognize 10 different object categories such as ✈️ airplane, 🐱 cat, and 🚚 truck.
🛠️ TensorFlow and Keras are used to build and train the model.
📊 The final accuracy shows the effectiveness of CNNs for image recognition tasks.
