Welcome to my Task-4 submission for the CODTECH Internship Program!
In this project, I’ve built a powerful Recommendation System using machine learning techniques to predict user preferences and suggest relevant items. 📈💡

🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this task was to create a Recommendation System using either:

🤝 Collaborative Filtering

🧮 Matrix Factorization

These techniques help in predicting what a user might like based on historical interaction data.

⚙️ Techniques Used
✔️ User-User Collaborative Filtering

✔️ Item-Item Collaborative Filtering

✔️ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

✔️ Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, Precision@K, Recall@K, etc.
